                    <p>Software Engineering is a programing in we developed the software for the computer system or any other E-devices.</p>
                    <p>Software engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design, development and maintenance of software. Software engineering was introduced to address the issues of low-quality software projects. Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of quality.</p>

                    <p><b className='main'>1.1 Software Product:-</b> </p>
                    <p>The final software that is delivered to the customer is called the software products.</p>

                    <p>It is the outcome of the entire software development process or you can say the result of SDLC </p>
                    <p>It may include source code, data, user guide, reference manuals, installation manuls, specifications documentation and other documentation etc.</p>
                    <p>The software products does not have any information regarding the software process.</p>
                    <p>
                        Like:- How it works schedule, how many people worked on in , How the work was devided etc.</p>
                    <p>It only consists of the final application that full filled customers requirements.</p>

                    <p><b className='main'>1.2 Software Process:-</b> </p>
                    <p>The  Software process is the entire way in which we produce a software.</p>
                    <p>It is the entire journey from the idea ðŸ’¡ to the final release of it.</p>
                    <p>It includes all the activities that are performed to form the final application or software.</p>
                    <p>
                        Like:- The requirements analysis, designing of the software, coding, testing, documentation, maintenance etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>Hence, the software process can also be defined as the collection of all the activities that the result lead to formation of the software product.</p>
                    <p>The software product may not contain the details about software process but the software process have every detail about the final product from the idea to the final release of the of it.</p>
