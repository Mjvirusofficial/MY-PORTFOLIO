DBMS Concepts and architecture Introduction

######Concept of DBMS#######

(a).Data
(b).Database
(c).Database management system

1.Data:- Data is nothing but you can say everything in digital form is know as data.

Data can anything it can be a number, a symbol, alphabet, audio, video etc etc everything is known as Data.

2.Database:- In simple term you can understand database as place where the collection of data are placed.

That means Database is a type of place where we strored the set or collection of related data.

3.DBMS:- Database management system. It is a software tool or manage system that is used to manage the data.

#######How we can manage the Database##################

• We can see all user details.

• Pick particular user information

•We can update the user like:- his name, his salary, his current location etc whatever we want we can change.

• Next is we can delete user

• We can add new users

• Filter user name wise, salary wise.


DBMS first stand for Data Base Management System.

it is software tool that is used to manage the Database.

Basically it's provide an interface to perform some operations like:- 

1.Creating and organising database.

2.Updating some particular information.

3.Finding some information from the database.

4. Delete particular information etc.



#######Best Example########

Imagine you have a collection of books at home, and you want to keep them organized so that you can easily find any book whenever you need it. 

Instead of scattering the books randomly, you decide to create a bookshelf and arrange the books in a systematic manner. 

The bookshelf acts as your "Database," and the way you organize the books on the bookshelf represents the "Data Model."

Now, you need a way to manage your bookshelf effectively, like adding new books, removing old ones, or finding a specific book quickly. Here's where the "Database Management System" comes into play. The DBMS is like a helpful librarian who maintains the bookshelf for you and allows you to perform various tasks:

1. **Adding Books**: When you buy a new book, you hand it over to the librarian (DBMS), and they place it in the appropriate spot on the bookshelf, making sure it's organized.

2. **Finding Books**: If you want to find a specific book, you tell the librarian its title (a query), and the librarian goes straight to that book on the bookshelf, so you can pick it up easily.

3. **Updating Information**: Let's say you want to change the title of a book because you found a better one. You inform the librarian, and they update the title on the bookshelf accordingly.

4. **Removing Books**: When a book becomes too old or you no longer need it, you ask the librarian to remove it from the bookshelf, and they do it for you.

5. **Keeping things organized**: The librarian ensures that all the books are properly arranged and that there are no duplicates on the bookshelf.

In this analogy:
- The books are like data entries in a database.
- The bookshelf represents the database where data is stored.
- The librarian symbolizes the DBMS that manages and handles data operations.

So, a Database Management System (DBMS) is like your personal librarian, taking care of your data, making it easy to access, and ensuring everything stays organized.

In other words DBMS first stand for Data Base Management System it is Software tool that is used to manage the Database.

Basically it's provide an interface to perform some operations like:- 

1.Creating and organising database.

2.Updating some particular information.

3.Finding some information from the database.

4. Delete particular information etc.


#####Archietecture of DBMS####

Let's explain the architecture of a Database Management System (DBMS) in simple terms with a relatable example.

The Architecture of DBMS is divided into four part:-

1.User Interface:- This is the part of the DBMS that help you to interact with database.

It's like the front door to the database.

You can use it to ask questions (queries) or tell the database what to do.

Just like you use a search bar on a website to find information, you use the user interface of a DBMS to find and manage data.

2.Query Processor:- When you ask a question (query) through the user interface, the query processor listens and understands what you want.

It figures out the best way to get the answer from the database efficiently.

It's like a helpful assistant who makes sure your question is clear and finds the right place to get the information.

3.Database Engine:- Once the query processor knows what you want, it talks to the database engine.

The database engine is like the brain of the DBMS. It knows where all the data is stored and how to get it.

It follows the instructions from the query processor and goes to the right place in the database to find the information which you asked.

4.Data Storage:- This is place where the actual data are placed. It's like a big organized storage room with lots of data. 

In a DBMS, data is organized into tables, just like how you might organize data in a spreadsheet. 

Each table contains specific information about data Like:- 

Supose you have user list then Name of user, Email of user, Website, address etc everything release user.



Let's see a example of "Library Database management system".

Imagine you're managing a library, and you want to use a DBMS to organize your books and library members.

1.User Interface:- You use a computer program with buttons and search boxes to interact with the library database.

This is the user interface where you can search for books, add new books, or check which members borrowed a book.

2.Query Processor:- When you type a book title in the search box the query processor understands your request and decides how best to find the book you're looking for.


3.Database Engine:- The database engine knows exactly where the "books" are placed means in which row data are placed which you looking for. 

4.Data Storage:- In the data storage room, there's a specific shelf (table) for books. Each row on the shelf contains information about a particular book, like the title, author, and availability status.

By using a DBMS for the library, you can easily find information about books, manage library member data, and keep track of borrowed books. 

The DBMS architecture makes it organized and efficient to handle a large amount of data and helps you get the information you need quickly.
