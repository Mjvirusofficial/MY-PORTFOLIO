            <p>Here, elements of set A = 1,2,3 is available in set B So, you can say set A is a subset of set B.</p>

            <p><span className="main">9.Super set:-</span> When set A is a subset of set B, Then B is called super set of A.

              For e.g:-
              A = [Alphabet] B = [Vowels] So, here B is a subset of set A , Then A is called super set of set A.</p>
            <p> B is less than A [B is the subset set of A]</p>
